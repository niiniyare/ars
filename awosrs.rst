### 1.6 Overview

The remaining part of the specification document is organized as follows.

-   **Section 2** defines overall description of the system which defines product perspectives and functions, use-case diagrams, classes and characteristics of involved users, the environment that the system is going to be deployed, constraints on design and implementation of the system, user documentation, assumptions and dependencies.

-   **Section 3** focuses on requirements and goal modelling. Strategic dependency model, model of software-intensive system, goal and agent responsibility model are used to model goals, while class diagram, state models and sequence diagram are constructed to model requirements.

-   **Section 4** contains all the specific requirements such as functional requirements, performance requirements and external interface requirements, which in turn includes user, software, hardware and communication interface requirements. Attributes of the software system and non-functional requirements are also specified in this section. Solution-oriented requirements extracted from requirements modelling part are documented in this section. Prioritization and traceability of requirements are also included in **Section 4**.

# 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

**Airline Ticketing reservation systems (ARS)** are part of the so-called passenger service systems (PSS), which are applications supporting the direct contact with the passenger. Airline reservation systems incorporate airline schedules, fare tariffs, passenger reservations and ticket records.An airline's direct distribution works within their own reservation system, as well as pushing out information to the GDS. ARS eventually evolved into the computer reservations system (CRS). A computer reservation system is used for the reservations of a particular airline and interfaces with a global distribution system (GDS) which supports travel agencies and other distribution channels in making reservations for most major airlines in a single system

**ATRS** is a direct distribution channel are consumers who use the internet or mobile applications to make their own reservations. Travel agencies and other indirect distribution channels access the same GDS as those accessed by the airline reservation systems.

Although the existing systems were performing the basic functions of the airlines and doing their best but not yet those who can meet the demand, There are a few systematic challenges that airlines are still facing that can be overcome.

currentlly systems can make schedules, search availability, book flights, Ticketing, refund, change date and arrenge departure basic. design of this **ATRS** come to do this jobs easy and smooth plus add missing Features that are needed.

-   \[ \] list current systems drawbacks.

The new system aims to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks of the existing system. It will allow users to make reservations according their needs from different parts of the world without leaving their places. Furthermore, it will reduce the workload of the employees who are responsible to make reservations at the office.

The system allows customers to check the availability of flights for specific dates and routes, get information about durations of available flights. It also allows customers to check the prices and the things that are included in the ticket such as baggage allowance, meal and etc. and booking the ticket. Administrator can modify, remove existing flights, also add new flights to the system. Furthermore, administrator can see customer requests about cancellation of bookings, and decide whether to accept and reject them.

### 2.2 Product Functions

The system will have 10 functionalities for customers and administrators and they are listed below.

#### 2.2.1 Search for flights

Description: Using this function a customer is able to search for one-way, round-trip and multiple destination flights by choosing specific dates and destinations.

#### 2.2.2 Specify passengers

Description: With the help of this function customer selects the number of passengers and their category, either adult, child or infant.

#### 2.2.3 Sort flights

Description: Regarding to this functions, customer sorts flights either by price or duration of the flight.

#### 2.2.4 Book flights

Description: This function allows customer to book flights by choosing ticket types and processing online payment.

#### 2.2.5 Request cancellation

Description: This function indicates that customer can request the cancellation of the reserved ticket.

**2.2.6 Add new flights**

Description: The function grants administrator the privilege of adding new flights to the system.

**2.2.7 Modify flight details**

Description: Using this functionality administrator can modify the details of the existing flights.

#### 2.2.8 Remove flights

Description: With the help of this function administrator removes the flights from the system that are cancelled for whatever reason.

#### 2.2.9 See cancellation requests

Description: This functionality allows administrator to overview the cancellation requests of customers, and approve or reject them.

**2.2.10 See booking details**

Description: This functionality enables administrator to view the customers' booking details.

### 2.3 Use-case Diagram

**Description:** In the use case diagram given below, we have displayed how our users interact with the system to accomplish their goals and responsibilities. Here in our diagram we have 4 actors (Customer, Administrator, Support Staff, Bank), 3 of which are the main users (Customer, Administrator, Support Staff). In every use case mentioned in the diagram, the actions of the users are described, and how these use cases are related to one another is represented by the help of arrows. In our Use case diagram all functionalities of the system are displayed. Customer can search for flights based on dates and destination, flights being one-way or round-trip, sort the displayed flights according to price or duration, specify the passengers (how many adults, children or infants), request cancellation, book flight, choose the ticket type and proceed with the payment. The payment is processed by the Bank. Another actor, Administrator, is responsible for adding new flights, modifying flight details and removing flights if needed, see the cancellation request, approve or deny them and see booking details. Our final actor, Support Staff, is responsible for maintenance of the system, ensuring the security of the system (by creating predefined users and maintaining AAS), safety of the system (by restoring and recovering data and assuring data integrity) and reliability of the system (by maintaining SLA).

### 2.4 User Classes and Characteristics

The system users are divided into three categories: administrators, customers and support staff. Administrators should be trained and have a knowledge about using this application. On the other hand, customers do not need a training or a background knowledge. Support staff consist of specialists who have good analytical and problem solving skills, up-to-date technical knowledge, good interpersonal and customer care skills.

### 2.5 User Interests

Customers' interests are getting information about available flights of specific dates and routes, knowing their durations, checking the prices of the tickets. They are also interested in what are included in different ticket types in terms of whether the ticket is refundable, include meal, what is the baggage limit for each type of ticket. Moreover, customers concern about booking flights without leaving the places where they are.

Administrator's interests include modifying, removing existing flights and adding new flights to the system. Furthermore, administrator can manage customers' cancellation requests in terms of either accepting or rejecting them.

Support staff's duties are maintaining performance, ensuring security and reliability of the system, alongside controlling AAS in terms of predefining administrator passwords, adding new administrator customized passwords to the system, and granting them administrator privileges.

### 2.6 Operating Environment

The designed system is thought to be a website and will be available via any web-browser application. It will not be dependent on the technical capabilities or operating system of user's device.

### 2.7 Design and Implementation Constraints

Flight dates and hours should be displayed according to the city of departure and destinations' time zones and the daylight saving time settings for each country should be considered. Additionally, information about any changes that are made in the database should be displayed with no delay.

**2.8 User Documentation**

The instructions on how to book a flight will be provided on the website for inexperienced users.

### 2.9 Assumptions and Dependencies

It is assumed that the user has an internet access and can do online payments. The performance of **ATRS** depends on the quality and speed of the internet connection.

### 3.2 Requirements Modelling

#### 3.2.1 Scope

Scope for our diagrams is focused on the implementation of Use Case ID 15, to customer booking a flight.

#### 3.2.2 Booking a Flight

`<img src="media/image6.jpg" style="width:6.5in;height:4.21875in" />`{=html}

### Figure 6. Booking a flight

**Description:** Customer class contains information about customers, such as their full names, locations, card details and genders. Operations performed by customers via interactions with administrator, bank, flight and flight tickets are contained in the respective part of the Customer class. Administrator class, on the other hand contains the data about the administrator (name and account details) and the operations he/she performs on the system. It relates to customer on approving or rejecting the cancellation requests made by the customer. Flight class is another key class in our diagram and contains information about flight such as destination and origin city, flight date, time and duration, number of seats and flight's availability. Ticket class is also essential for our diagram and contains the full name of the customer that it belongs to. It has its own unique ID, price and type, which expands to Standard, Premium or VIP class tickets. The last class in the diagram belongs to Bank and as operations its payment processing and receipt generating functions are specified.

##### 3.2.3 State Models

**Description:** As visible in class diagram, administrator can add or remove flights to the system. In state diagrams these functionalities displayed as finite states. In first diagram, administrator gets information about a new flight, adds the flight to the system and it is visible to the rest of the users of the system. Second one displays administrator being informed of cancelled flight, removing it and checking whether it is still available on the system. In third diagram, booking flight and making payment functionalities of customer are explained. Here, customer books a flight, he/she is asked to proceed with payment, and the process is finished if customer has enough fund to make payment. In the last diagram bank handles the payment made by the customer. Bank receives information about the payment, processes the payment and generates the receipt.

#### 4.8.2 Traceability Model

`<img src="media/image26.jpg" style="width:5.44792in;height:4.41667in" />`{=html}

## Figure 15. Traceability model

In the given model following subtypes are defined under the traceability types of Content, Abstraction and Evolution:

### Content

-   *Contradicts* **-** inconsistency in the requirements artefacts

-   *Conflicts* **-** realisation of requirement A may hinder (but does not necessarily exclude) the realisation of requirement B

**Abstraction**

-   *Generalizes* - artefact is a generalisation of (one or) several other artefacts

### Evolution

-   *Satisfies* - if artefact A is realised in the system, artefact B is realised as well

-   *Based on* - artefact A has influenced the definition of artefact B

-   *Formalizes* - artefact A is a formal documentation of artefact B

-   *Derived* - artefact A was derived based on a set of other artefact

### 5. Prototype

**Description: Visualisation of website.**

We try to visualize website of ITM Airlines and while customers using this website, they can take several advantage of it. On the other hand, it is narrow version of website in order to make it much more clear and understandable. In the first stage, customers will enter to home page of website. Then, they can choose type of the ticket, number of adults/children/infants, sort tickets either by duration or by price, and in this prototype, customers can only search tickets for one way trip. Moreover, we were add sign in and register buttons for administrators in order to register/enter the system itself. Finally, there are several buttons such as feedback, currency and language buttons that allow customer in order to give their feedbacks about website, change currency and language.
