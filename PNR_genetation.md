Generating a PNR (Passenger Name Record) programmatically involves a series of steps, from data collection to PNR generation and booking reference assignment. The process typically involves working with a CRS (Computer Reservation System) or a GDS (Global Distribution System) like Amadeus, Sabre, or Travelport [Source 0](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/pnr-explained/).

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the PNR generation process:

1. **Data collection**: Essential trip data is gathered when a passenger or organization books a flight through a travel retailer, such as a carrier's website, an online travel agency (OTA), a travel management company (TMC), or a tour operator [Source 0](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/pnr-explained/).

2. **Data submission to the CRS**: The reservation data is transmitted to the airline's CRS. Most airlines don't run their own CRS and instead host inventory and manage bookings on one of the major GDSs [Source 0](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/pnr-explained/).

3. **Initial PNR generation**: A carrier's operator or authorized travel agent logs into the CRS/GDS to build a PNR file with the required elements [Source 0](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/pnr-explained/).

4. **Booking reference assignment**: The system generates a unique booking reference (also called a record locator, reservation code, or PNR number), which is assigned to the PNR file. It serves as a digital address of the document in the airline's database [Source 0](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/pnr-explained/).

5. **Booking confirmation**: The travel retailer sends an email with the booking reference to the passenger as a reservation confirmation. The ticket will be issued only after the passenger pays the fare [Source 0](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/pnr-explained/).

6. **Updates and addition of new details**: If required, the agent or operator adds new data elements or makes changes to the record. The PNR is updated every time the reservation information is altered [Source 0](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/pnr-explained/).

In some cases, a Super PNR (or Master Itinerary) is created to manage multiple PNRs belonging to the same trip, especially when different carriers or services are involved in the itinerary [Source 2](https://www.travel-industry-blog.com/gds/pnr/).

When generating a PNR programmatically, you would typically interact with the APIs provided by the CRS or GDS systems that host the airline's inventory and reservations. These APIs allow you to create, update, and manage PNRs within their systems.

The future of PNRs might be influenced by IATA's ONE Order initiative, which aims to consolidate all travel data into a single XML file within a single system, simplifying the process for providers and travel agents [Source 0](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/pnr-explained/).
