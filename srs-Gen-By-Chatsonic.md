A Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is a formal written description of the requirements for an Airline Reservation System. This document should detail functional and non-functional requirements, as well as external and internal interfaces.

### Functional Requirements.

- Enable users to book flights, view available flights, and manage bookings
- Provide users with the ability to search for flights by destination, date and time, and number of passengers
- Allow users to select their own seats
- Store user information in secure databases
- Allow users to add additional services such as meals or transportation
- Offer payment gateway integration
- Provide real-time flight status updates
- Include a secure login system

### Non-functional Requirements.
- The system must be user-friendly and easy to navigate
- The system must be accessible from any device (desktop, mobile, etc.)
- The system must be able to handle large amounts of data
- The system must be designed with a high level of security
- The system must be able to process payments quickly and accurately

### External Interfaces.

- Payment gateway
- Airlines
- Travel agencies

### Internal Interfaces.

- Database
- User interface
- Administration interface.

You can calculate the distance between two points (given the latitude/longitude of those points) using the haversine formula and writing JavaScript code. The code would look like this: 

// Haversine Formula
function getDistance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2) {
	var R = 6371; // Radius of the earth in km
	var dLat = (lat2-lat1) * Math.PI / 180;  // deg2rad below
	var dLon = (lon2-lon1) * Math.PI / 180; 
	var a = 
		Math.sin(dLat/2) * Math.sin(dLat/2) +
		Math.cos(lat1 * Math.PI / 180 ) * Math.cos(lat2 * Math.PI / 180 ) * 
		Math.sin(dLon/2) * Math.sin(dLon/2); 
	var c = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1-a)); 
	var d = R * c; // Distance in km
	return d;
}.
