Abstract: Airline ticket prices frequently change, which is usually caused by yield
management as price discrimination practice. Recently, buyers of online airline tickets
tend to complain about price discrimination based on customer profiling, e.g. by means
of cookie data. As cookie data and other directly or indirectly obtained customer
information is easily available via the Internet, airlines may use this information to offer
personalized ticket prices. In a month-long experiment, in which prices of airline tickets
were tracked, we found that cookies were not used to determine prices. However,
customer information from other direct sources seems to be important in dynamic
pricing. Besides, it was discovered that most price changes occurred in the morning;
these were usually minor price changes and were mostly seen at full-service carriers.

__1. Introduction__ 

Airlines are challenged to maximize sales and minimize inventory of perishable
assets: flight seats. To achieve these objectives, dynamic pricing may be implemented, which
is a form of price discrimination (Krugman, 2000). The goal of dynamic pricing is not
particularly to attract more money from customers (McAfee and te Velde, 2006), but to
allocate the right price to the right capacity (Kimes, Chase, Choi, Lee and Ngonzi, 1998).
However, as ticket prices frequently change, and customers are increasingly aware of these
changes, the question emerges what underlying practices influence dynamic pricing.
Yield management as basis of airline ticket pricing is a common practice among
airlines leading to price discrimination and often to unfair price perceptions among customers.
It deals with the trade-off between selling a ticket immediately but at a low price, or waiting
for a customer willing to pay more money but with the implied risk that in the end the ticket
will not be sold (Alderighi, Nicoli and Piga, 2012).
With the recent technology advances customer profiling practices are now a realistic
option; due to increased access to customer information, customer profiling could result in
price discrimination on even individual level. The role of direct information (e.g. profile
registration) of customers on airline ticket prices has already been investigated and is often
used to segment the market based on willingness-to-pay (Bailey, 1998). However, there is not
yet evidence of even scientific research on indirectly obtained customer information (e.g.
cookie data) that is used for the purpose of applying price discrimination to flight tickets.
In this research, two airline price discrimination practices are explored, with focus on
the potential role of customer profiling and yield management as rationales of dynamic
pricing. Therefore, in this research, the hypotheses that (1) customer profiling affects airline
ticket prices and (2) yield management affects airline ticket prices are tested.
This article is structured as follows. In section 2, a literature review provides an
explanation of the terms dynamic pricing, yield management and customer profiling.
Subsequently, the research methodology and results of this experiment are presented. Last,
the findings and limitations of this study and possibilities for future research are discussed.

__2. Literature Review__

__2.1 The concept of dynamic pricing__

Based on unpredictable demand, and its perishability of inventory, airlines are
challenged to minimize inventory and maximize profit (Kimes, Chase, Choi, Lee and Ngonzi,
1998). One technique to achieve those goals is dynamic pricing, which allows charging prices
based on segmentation and differences in willingness-to-pay (Klein and Loebbecke, 2000).
Accordingly, companies are able to allocate resources and optimize occupancy through
dynamic pricing (McAfee and te Velde, 2006).
Despite the appliance of dynamic pricing strategies by many airlines, information
about its actual functioning is purposely withheld due to its highly competitive environment
(Etzioni, Tuchinda, Knoblock and Yates, 2002). However, literature has extensively discussed
dynamic pricing. Kimes, Chase, Choi, Lee and Ngonzi (1998) describe it as the process of
“allocating the right price to the right capacity to the right customer at the right place at the
right time” (p. 33). Reinartz (2002) refers to price customization, which is defined as
“charging different prices to end customers based on a discriminatory variable” (p. 55). As the
price of a relatively identical product differs, it would be interesting to understand the
underlying practice of dynamic pricing.


__2.2 Yield management as price discrimination practice__

Yield management was first introduced in the airline industry and refers to “a broad
set of techniques that are profitably used by companies as airlines and hotels, to implement a
price discrimination policy when customers are heterogeneous, demand is uncertain and
capacity is hardly modifiable” (Alderighi, Nicoli and Piga, 2012, p. 2). With yield
management practices, airlines try to control prices and inventory, but also to improve service
to its individual customers. Alderighi, Nicoli and Piga (2012) mention a capacity-driven
approach, and inter-temporal price discrimination (based on heterogeneity of customers) as
examples. Yield management practices have extensively been discussed in literature and
based on a literature review various mediators have been identified.
First, an airline’s supply influences ticket prices as it is based on its capacity. Birtan
and Caldentey (2003) mention flexibility and perishability as moderators within this category.
Flexibility enables airlines to relate supply to forecasted demand. Perishability relates to the
ability to preserve capacity over time and is defined as inventory, which is the number of
seats unsold at a certain point in time. Second, airlines encounter a wide range of costs, which
should be taken into account while determining prices. Fixed and variable costs (e.g. aircraft
maintenance, crew costs, fuel and catering), individualization costs (i.e. booking and yield
management systems), and shelf life costs (i.e. perishability) should be taken into account
(Klein and Loebbecke, 2000). Third, competition may influence price, as the presence of low-
cost carriers puts pressure on full service carriers (Mantin and Koo, 2009). A traditional
distinction between business and leisure travelers seems to fade, whereas on short- and
medium-haul destinations, a significant number of business passengers is willing to sacrifice
certain services and thus chooses a low-cost carrier (Martinez-Garcia, Ferrer-Rosell and
Coenders, 2012). The Internet has contributed to these movements, as the platform serves as a
source of information about airlines, flights, and destinations; consequently, customer
awareness on prices increases. Forth, a traveler’s itinerary influences a ticket price. Based on
route length, different pricing patterns appear, whereas long-haul flights evidently decrease in
price within the price metrics (Mantin and Gillen, 2011). Fares can also be influenced by
route frequency and the percentage of fully booked flights (Malighetti, Paleari and Redondi,
2009). Last, demand may influence prices. In this sense, time before departure may be
considered as moderator, about which contradicting opinions exist. Some authors believe that
prices charged are higher when the departure date comes closer (Malighetti, Paleari and
Redondi, 2009; Mantin and Koo, 2009), whereas others believe it shows a non-linear pattern
(Anderson and Wilson, 2003; Mantin and Gillen, 2011)

__2.3 Customer profiling as price discrimination practice__

Dynamic pricing causes price changes over time, from customer to customer, and
from various bundles of products and services (Kannan and Kopalle, 2001). To implement
this practice, information about customers is crucial; a personalized offer can then be made
(Klein and Loebbecke, 2000). The required information can be obtained via direct sources
(e.g. consumer registration) or indirect sources. To collect the latter, cookie files can be
valuable (Alreck and Settle, 2007; Berger, 2010). Bailey (1998) defines a cookie as “a
“writable” file for the retailer on the consumer’s client. Any information can be stored there
and that information can be retrieved at some time in the future by the same retailer (p. 15).”
Whereas information from direct sources is provided with the explicit consent of
consumers, information without explicit consent of customers is retrieved via cookies or other
electronic tracking tools (Dwyer, 2009). Recent research has clarified that indirect


information sources are used for marketing purpose, which is called behavioral targeting
(Berger, 2010). Consumer’s behavior is tracked via cookie data and consequently,
advertisement or other services are customized based on this information. Behavioral tracking
even uses customer information from electronic tools to get insight in a customer’s search
behavior and gives companies the opportunity to tailor pages, offers and prices meeting the
customer’s interest (Alreck and Settle, 2007; Bailey, 1998). Klein and Loebbecke (2000) call
this concept of customer profiling “micro-segmentation”, in which a company’s offering on
the web will automatically be differentiated based on electronic tracking tools. It allows
companies to track searching and buying patterns to evaluate and forecast individual
customer’s values. Based on these interpretations, it is possible to offer individualized deals.
Correct application of these practices may provide competitive advantage to a
company. However negative consequences may occur too. If companies charge differentiated
prices to individual customers based on customer profiling, customers might feel betrayed
when they are aware of the fact that they have paid another (higher) price than another
customer. This however depends on the nature of the product; dynamic pricing of perishable
goods is generally accepted, while dynamic pricing of nonperishable goods is not (Kannan
and Kopalle, 2001).
Whereas prices of tickets frequently change, most customers may perceive these
changes as a result of discriminative practices. Although literature has acknowledged the
existence of customer profiling practices, there is not yet research evidence on the appliance
of customer profiling as a basis for price discrimination in the airline industry. Online ticket
sales and online customer information can provide a great database of customer information,
which could be used by airlines to personalize prices.

__3. Methodology__

This study investigates the potential role of customer profiling on price dynamics in
online airline ticket sales. Therefore, a distinction between two types of customers has been
made. An existing, regularly returning customer known to the airline by means of cookie data
and a new customer, who is unknown to the airline were distinguished. An experiment was
executed by using two computers requesting ticket prices from four European airlines: two
full-service (airline 1 and 2) and two low-cost carriers (airline 3 and 4). The two users were
asking the price of itineraries by the four airlines, three times a day simultaneously on fixed
times, for a period of one month. The computers were two identical notebooks simulating two
different conditions. On one notebook, cookies were enabled and in principle any online
behavioral tracking was possible. The other notebook was clean, and no behavioral tracking
information was available for customer profiling practices. The clean notebook had a dynamic
IP address and was programmed to perform an automatic reset every time it was switched off
to erase any traceable tracking indications after each session. To make the comparison even
more reliable, all search queries were executed simultaneously so that price variations
between the two computers due to yield management would be impossible.
The initial intention was to check all four airlines for exactly the same itineraries, but
some of the routes were not flown by all airlines. Departures were from Amsterdam Schiphol
Airport (airline 1, 2 and 4) or Eindhoven Airport (airline 3). Destinations of airlines 1 and 2
included New York, Barcelona, Bali and Istanbul. Destinations of airline 3 consisted of
Stockholm, Barcelona, Rome and Dublin. Destinations of airline 4 were Zakynthos,
Barcelona, Luxor and Istanbul. These different itineraries did not affect the validity of the
experiment to answer the first hypothesis, because the actual itinerary is not relevant to this
research purpose.


Although it was not the primary intention, based on the chosen research methodology,
it was possible to track price changes over time, which may occur due to yield management.
By tracking prices during one month, it was possible to analyze a potential price pattern at
three moments of the day (morning, afternoon and evening). Competition as mediator was
investigated by analyzing pricing difference between the two types of carriers.

__4. Results__

  __4.1 Customer profiling as price discrimination practice__
The first aim of the research was to find whether price discrimination of airlines was
based on customer profiling due to obtaining information from cookie data or other user
profiling methods. The results were manually registered into an Excel sheet that indicated no
differences in the prices between both situations: the prices charged were identically the same
at all sessions. With this result, the hypothesis that prices differ based on cookie data or other
tracking tools, is not confirmed.

  __4.2 Yield management as price discrimination practice__

Analysis of the data from the experiment provides insight in the role of competition as
price mediator. More price changes have been found at the two full-service carriers than at the
two low-costs carriers. Whereas the low-cost carriers (airline 3 and 4) count for only nine
changes (13%) in total, the full-service carriers (airline 1 and 2) together count for 60
changes, which is 87% of all changes. While analyzing price dispersion, it was found that
most price changes (52,17%) were between 0% and 5% and may be either a price decrease or
increase. Within this category, most of the changes (75%) are between 0% and 1%, which
means a minor change of a few euros or even eurocents. The second biggest category is
responsible for price changes between 5% and 10%, which is 27,54% of all changes (19 out
of 69). Changes within this category are mostly found between 5%-6% (42,11%).
Furthermore, some outliers are identified, which are showed at airline 1 and 3. Airline 1 has
implemented a compulsory cancellation option in the second week of the experiment, which
cannot be switched off. This measure might be the reason for two exceptional high price
increases on a ticket to Bali (37% and 46%). Airline 3 counts for an outlier on its Stockholm
flight, which reflects a 40% price decrease in week 4.
As time before departure could not be investigated due to the length of the experiment,
the moment on which a ticket was searched might cause price changes. In the experiment,
during 18 days prices have been tracked at three moments a day: morning, afternoon and
evening. Analysis of the number of changes shows that the majority of price fluctuations
occur in the morning (UTC+1:00) at all airlines (39 out of 69 changes or 56,5%). Changes
that occurred at the afternoon and in the evening counted for respectively 29% and 14,5%.

__5. Discussion__

In this research, customer profiling and yield management as price discrimination
practices were investigated. The assumption of Kannan and Kopalle (2001) that prices are
personalized through customer profiling is not confirmed in this particular case. Whereas
airlines sell a large amount of their tickets via the Internet, customer information can easily be
obtained via electronic tracking tools; this outcome was unexpected. On the other hand, price


discrimination based on customer profiling may harm the relationship between customer and
airline. Airlines may be careful with applying such practices.
Based on the literature, however, it may be assumed that directly obtained customer
information is used by airlines. Applying the moderator time before departure, airlines may
use directly obtained information to segment the market into price sensitive and price
insensitive travelers (Anderson and Wilson, 2003; Mantin and Gillen, 2011).
Competitive pressure may influence full-service carriers in their pricing mechanisms
(Mantin and Koo, 2009). Therefore they seem to integrate yield management practices to
charge different prices to different customers. As full-service carriers segment their market in
both business travelers and leisure travelers, they are able to target both markets when they
apply a dynamic pricing system (Anderson and Wilson, 2003). However, the distinction
between the business and leisure segment appears to fade, especially on short- and long-haul
flights, as business travelers are willing to sacrifice certain services and increasingly start to
make use of low-cost carriers (Martinez-Garcia, Ferrer-Rosell and Coender, 2012).
Due to the Internet, customers become more aware of price changes and may be
unsatisfied, as they cannot rely on stable prices. Therefore, it would be an option to airlines
“to educate customers about the need for dynamic pricing: inventory clearance sales in the
Internet domain, over a short time horizon, may result in dynamic prices for items” (Kannan
and Kopalle, 2001, p. 79). Consequently, limited transparency about dynamic pricing might
positively adjust customer’s expectations. However airlines should be careful with the extent
of information transparency, since pricing seems to be a source of competitive advantage
(Etzioni, Tuchinda, Knoblock and Yates, 2002).
This study provided some insights into the practice of dynamic pricing of airlines. The
conditions contributed to the validity of the outcome that in this case customer profiling has
not been used to price discriminate; however not all mediators of yield management could be
tested. Therefore, there are several limitations, as well as suggestions for future research.
First, the study only used four of the many airlines that exist in the aviation industry. The
tested airlines were all European. Other airlines both within and outside Europe were not
considered. They might have another approach towards pricing strategies. Second, only a
limited sample of destinations was considered within this research. The results are based on
the prices of tickets to these destinations, but leave other destinations disregarded. Third,
prices were only studied on working days, and may be different than during the weekend.
Forth, this experiment was executed for only one month, in which time before departure is
four months in the future. This characteristic limits the ability to analyze the possibility of
segmentation based on time before departure.
Future research should take these limitations into account. First, extending the number
of airlines and destinations may be valuable. Destinations might also act as a moderator. Non-
direct flights might be investigated, since these are influenced by potential charges and prices
of these related flight tickets could fluctuate. Furthermore, the moderator time before
departure can be tested more extensively, as a contradicting opinion exists of the role of this
moderator. Last, future researchers could investigate if price differences are based on
computer operating systems, i.e. Windows and Apple Macintosh. Companies may assume
that Apple users may have a higher budget and may charge them higher prices.
