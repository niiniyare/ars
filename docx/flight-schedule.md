The flight schedule file you provided is in a specific format that resembles the IATA (International Air Transport Association) SSIM (Standard Schedules Information Manual) format. This format is widely used by airlines to exchange flight schedule data with airports, GDSs (Global Distribution Systems), and other stakeholders in the aviation industry [Source 1]() [Source 3]() [Source 4].

The data in the file is structured and includes various elements, such as airline codes, flight numbers, departure and arrival times, airport codes, and other information, all defined in a specific order that forms a structural hierarchy [Source 1][Source 3].

Here's a breakdown of the different elements of the flight schedule file:

- **AirlineCode; FlightNumber; Date-Range; DOW; Legs; Segments;**

    The first line of the file is a header that describes the different columns in the file. 

    - **AirlineCode**: The code of the airline operating the flight (e.g., SQ).
    - **FlightNumber**: The specific number for the flight (e.g., 11).
    - **Date-Range**: The range of dates when this flight is scheduled (e.g., 2010-01-15 to 2010-02-28).
    - **DOW**: Days of the week the flight operates, represented as a 7-digit number where each digit represents a day of the week (e.g., 1111111 means the flight operates every day of the week) [Source 0].
    - **Legs**: Contains information about the individual legs of the flight.
    - **Segments**: Contains information about the individual segments of the flight [Source 2].

- **Legs: BoardPoint; OffPoint; BoardTime; ArrivalDateOffSet; ArrivalTime; ElapsedTime; LegCabins;**

    The Legs section provides details about each leg of the flight.

    - **BoardPoint**: The airport code where passengers board the flight (e.g., SIN).
    - **OffPoint**: The airport code where passengers disembark the flight (e.g., BKK).
    - **BoardTime**: The scheduled boarding time (e.g., 08:20).
    - **ArrivalDateOffSet**: The number of days offset from the departure date for the arrival (e.g., 0).
    - **ArrivalTime**: The scheduled arrival time (e.g., 11:00).
    - **ElapsedTime**: The total elapsed time for the flight leg (e.g., 07:40).
    - **LegCabins**: Contains information about the cabins in the flight leg.

- **LegCabins: CabinCode; Capacity;**

    The LegCabins section provides information about the cabins on each leg of the flight.

    - **CabinCode**: The code for the cabin (e.g., Y).
    - **Capacity**: The passenger capacity of the cabin (e.g., 300).

- **Segments: Specific; FareFamily: Frat5 curve, Disutility curve (for QFF), Class**

    The Segments section provides information about individual flight segments.

Understanding this format can be challenging due to its level of detail and the need for expertise in managing SSIM data [Source 1]. However, it is crucial for airlines to manage their flight schedules, exchange route data with GDSs, and ensure consistent and reliable service for their customers [Source 1][Source 3][Source 4][Source 5].
